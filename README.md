# reacttodolistapp

Hello to all developers.
This is a to do list that i coded it in React Js with Javascript.
I just add a task with a category as friends, work or family.
When i add a task i give a background color for every different category.
When you click on task, an edit and a delete button appears.
You can edit or delete the task.
I did not an array or localstorage or database.
Everything happens in page.
